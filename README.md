I don't know completely what I'm using github for, however this will probably be where I'll code my website sometime in the future.

Where I am on other platforms:
Twitter - https://twitter.com/Offbeet2886
Discord Server - https://discord.gg/fVsV2zJD9
Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFz0...
Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/offbeet2886
(Eventually this section will be replaced with the website mentioned above.)
